	<h1>The Purpose of C</h1>
	<h3>Some Background</h3>
	<p>Before and during the early 1970's, it was common to write operating systems in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language">assembly</a>, 
	a low-level programming language. The first implementation of the Unix operating system was written in assembly to run on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-7">PDP-7</a> computer and later 
	was ported, by modifying the original assembly code, to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11">PDP-11</a>. Since writing and porting assembly for larger systems is difficult, first Ken Thompson 
	and later Dennis Richie decided to create languages to make this process easier. Thompson created the 
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_(programming_language)">B</a> language that Richie used as a starting point when creating the earliest versions of
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)#Early_developments">C</a>. By the end of 1973, the Unix kernel had been rewritten 
	completely in C, making it easier to port to new versions of hardware.</p>
	<p>C, then, was a language designed for writting operating systems and device drivers. The patterns you use when you write C are those you would
		use if you were writing code for the PDP-11. Thankfully, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_C_Compiler">portable C compiler</a> 
	lead the way to making C available on multiple hardware systems that don't follow the PDP-11 hardware patterns. While porting Unix is not an insignificant 
	task, the C language has made several flavors of Unix such as Solaris, MacOS, HP-UX, the BSD variants, and AIX possible. 
	Linux, a Unix-like system, is also written in C.</p>
	<p>While you will not be writting code to run on a PDP-11, you pretend to do so anytime you use the C language. In computer science terms, you will
	write to the PDP-11 model even though you are writing code for a modern hardware architecture.</p>
	<h3>Python and C are Related</h3>
	<p>Take a look at Figure 1. It shows the ancestery of both C and Python. Since C is an ancestor of Python you can expect to see some
	things in C that remind you of what you learned about coding in Python. C is not Python's only ancester. A very strong contributor to Python 
	is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modula">Modula language</a>. Because of this ancestry, modules exist in Python even though the are
	absent from C. Echos of Modulo's for-loops and ranges, amoung other things, can also be seen in Python. C has no concept of a range and, as you will see, the syntax 
	and structure of for loops is different from what you learned for Python.</p>
