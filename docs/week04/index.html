	<h1>Lists and Beyond</h1>
	<p>Lists are wonderful things. If you need to keep several things together and in order so you can work with
	them, a list is the way to go. Lists in Clojure, in additionto functions, are a fundimental type. Clojure is, after all, 
	a LISP variant and LISP is short for LISt Processing.</p> 
	<p>You have seen lists in 
	the examples already. They begin with the '(' character and end with the ')' character. For example, here is a list of the first few 
	integers.</p>

<p><pre>
	<code class="Clojure">(1 2 3 4 5 6 7)</code>
</pre>
</p>
	<p>Here is another list.</p>
<p><pre>
	<code class="Clojure">(println "What????")</code>
</pre>
</p>
	<p>"But wait a minute!", you say. "That's a call to the println function!" You are exactly right. Function calls are lists...
		and if you examine the factorial function declaration from last week,</p>
	<p><pre>
	<code class="Clojure">(defn factorial
  ([n] (factorial n 1)) 
  ([n accumulator] 
   (if (= n 0) accumulator 
     (recur (dec n) (* accumulator n)))))</code></pre>
	</p>
	<p> you will discover that it, and all function declarations in Clojure, are lists inside of lists. That explains why there are so many 
	parenthases.</p>
	<h3>Vectors</h3>
	<p>The data collection type known as a vector is similar to a list with one huge difference, if you are using a vector you can get access to a 
	value directly using its index. This is very fast and something you can't do with a list. Here is an example of making a vector 
	and eventually getting the 3rd item out.</p>
<p><pre>
<code class="Clojure">(def vec [0 -1 345 18])
(vec 3)</code></pre>
	</p>	
	<p>When you run this code, (vec 3) returns 18. That's because Clojure follows a 0 based indexing scheme like most other languages. To 
	get the value 345, you would write (vec 2) and to get the 'first' value you would write (vec 0).</p>
	<p>If again you look back to last week's learning, you will discover that when you declare the parameters of a function, you do so using 
	a vector.</p>
	<p>Clojure includes some important functions that you can apply to vectors. These functions are so important that a senior engineer at 
		a VERY large tech company has gone so far to say that, regarless of what language you are writting in,
		if you are using loops instead of these, "You are doing it wrong."</p>
	<h3>Reduce</h3>
	<p>
		Any time you have a vector and need a single result by doing calculation on the elements of the vector, you are reducing many values to one. 
		That's why the BIF (Built In Function) to do this for you is called 'reduce.' To keep things simple, say you need to sum a list of integers. 
		This is how you would do it without using a loop.
	</p>
	<p><pre>
	<code class="Clojure">(def sum (reduce + [1 2 3 12 15 -4 0 18 2005]))</code></pre>
	</p>
	<p>Maybe you have a list of doubles defined as 'grades' somewhere in your code and need the average. Here is one way you could do this.
<p><pre>
	<code class="Clojure">(def grades [90.1 95.0 85.5 0.0 100.0])
;;
;; a bunch of code inbetween
;;
;;
(def avg (/(reduce + grades) (count grades)))</code></pre>
</p>
<b>I DON'T LIKE THIS EXAMPLE. FIND ONE THAT HAS MORE RELEVANCE!!!</b>
<p>In these examples of calling reduce use the '+' BIF. What if there aren't any BIFs that do what you need? The reduce 
function allows you to pass any function to deal with your data, even one that isn't bound to a name. Here is an example where a bonus of 10% has 
been added to the grades by a generous instructor.</p>
<p><pre>
	<code class="Clojure">(def grades [90.1 95.0 85.5 0.0 100.0])
;;
;; a bunch of code inbetween
;;
;;
</code></pre>
</p>
<p>You also use the reduce function to <a href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/reduce"> merge lists and do other interesting things</a>.

<h3>Map</h3>
<p>If you have a bunch of data and you need to do something with that data and return the same number of pieces of data, the reduce 
	function won't work well for you. Instead, you should apply the map function. That's what it is designed to do.</p>
<p>Let's say you have a nice instructor who has decided to increase the scores in the grades vector seen above. This is how 
	you would code this, using standard anonymous shorthand syntax,
<p><pre>
	<code class="Clojure">(map (fn [grade] (+ 10 grade)) grades)
	</code></pre></p>
	<p>or, using the anonymous function shorthand syntax, it would be this.</p>
<p><pre>
	<code class="Clojure">(map #(+ 10 %1) grades)
</code></pre></p>
<p>The map function is quite flexible. You can accomplish <a href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/map"> a lot with it</a>, 
but there is yet another common function you can use to make your life easier and avoid nasty, slow looping code.</p>
</p>
<h3>Filter</h3>
<p>There will come a time when you will need to filter something out of a vector of values. In the silly example we've been 
working with, maybe the instructor realized that the assignments were messed up and wants to drop any grade less than 80.0
from the grades. The filter function lets you filter out all list elements and do it without a loop.</p>

<p><pre>
	<code class="Clojure">(def updated (filter #(< 80.0 %1) grades))
	</code></pre></p>

<p>The filter function is <a href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/filter">also very flexible</a> but the true power of 
these functions is using them together.</p>
<p>Think about how you might wright some Python loops to modify everything in a list, filter the results of that update, and 
then use those results to calculate a singe answer. That's a lot of looping and a lot of loops to track and maintain. You do 
this type of process all the time when you do statistical and other calculations on data sets, but let's do it with our silly grades example. 
What is the average grade if 10% is added to each grade, any grade less than 80.0 is dropped, and then the average is taken? 
The code would look like this using the shorthand syntax for anonymous functions.</p>

<p><pre>
	<code class="Clojure">(/ (reduce + (filter #(< 80.0 %1) (map #(+ 10 %1) grades))) (count grades))
	</code></pre></p>

<p>Now don't panic. It's just function calls inside of function calls...lists inside of lists. Take some time. Break it into 
pieces looking at the innermost function first and working out from there.</p>
<p>This is all fine and dandy, but what about more complicated data? Consider this situation. You find you need to write 
	code to track medications in a pharmacy. If you do this with vectors, your code looks something like this.</p>
	<p>
<pre><code class="Clojure">(def medications [["Lactated Ringers" "levothyroxine" "rosuvastatin" "albuterol" "esomeprazole"] 
		   ["100L" "2000ct" "1500ct" "1325ct" "23145ct"] 
		   ["i13ab7" "iat342" "igr5423" "iuy6532" "imnb78932"] 
		   ["12/30/2029" "03/18/2021" "09/01/2020" "01/01/2023" "10/01/2021"]])
</code>
	</pre></p>
	Or worse,
	<p>
<pre><code class="Clojure">(def medications [["Lactated Ringers" "levothyroxine" "rosuvastatin" "albuterol" "esomeprazole"] ["100L" "2000ct" "1500ct" "1325ct" "23145ct"] ["i13ab7" "iat342" "igr5423" "iuy6532" "imnb78932"] ["12/30/2029" "03/18/2021" "09/01/2020" "01/01/2023" "10/01/2021"]])
</code>
	</pre></p>
	and worst of all,
	<p>
<pre><code class="Clojure">(def names ["Lactated Ringers" "levothyroxine" "rosuvastatin" "albuterol" "esomeprazole"]) 
(def amount ["100L" "2000ct" "1500ct" "1325ct" "23145ct"]) 
(def id ["i13ab7" "iat342" "igr5423" "iuy6532" "imnb78932"]) 
(def expiration ["12/30/2029" "03/18/2021" "09/01/2020" "01/01/2023" "10/01/2021"])
</code>
	</pre></p>
	<p>These approaches are bad. They are intrinsically unstable. You will have to write and test a whole bunch of code to make the CRUD (Create,Read,Update,Delete) features 
		work, and you will have bugs in your code. Despite your best efforts, the data about the medications will become corrupted. It is too difficult to 
	keep everything straight. Bugs will creap into this code and the application it is part of will fail. Thankfully,
	the creators of Clojure provided a way out of this mess...the map.</p>	
	<h3>Maps - keeping related data together </h3>
	<p>Maps allow us to mingle different types of data together, and build relationships between the pieces of data. Using the 
	medication example, you could create a map called medication that holds the medication's name, its manufacturer, its best-by
	date, and the amount of the medication on hand, all in one place for each medication. Then you can have a whole bunch of these 
	medications in a list if needed.</p>
	<p>When you make a map, you need to have a name for each value you are going to put in the map. You are 'mapping' the name to the value. 
		This means that when you want the value back out of the map, all you need to do is use the name mapped to the value.
	</p>
	<p>To define one of the medications from above using a map, you could write code like this.
	<p>
<pre><code class="Clojure">(def i13ab7 {:name "Lactated Ringers" :amount "100L" :expiration "12/30/2029"})
</code>
	</pre></p>
	<p>The most common way to get any individual piece of information from a map, you use the piece's key like this.
<p>
<pre><code class="Clojure">(def an-amount (i13ab7 :amount))
</code>
	</pre></p>
	</p>
	<p>This example defines the an-amount value as the amount of the medication with the id i13ab7. In reality, rarely would you write the code for a single medication from a data set. Instead, it is likely that you would 
		get a large data set consisting of tens if not hundreds of thousands of medications from a database, a file, or from a remote machine over 
		a network using HTTP. You would then be using CRUD features to manipulate and/or retrieve specific pieces of data. In this 
		very common type of situation, you would be working with a map containing maps. Look at this example which would be the code 
		creating a map of maps from the medication examples we've been looking at. In this example, the id of the medication is used 
		as the medication's key in the map of medications.
	</p>


	<p>
<pre><code class="Clojure">(def medications {:i13ab7 {:name "Lactated Ringers" :amount "100L" :expiration "12/30/2029"} 
:iat342 {:name "levothyroxine" :amount "2000ct" :expiration "03/18/2021"} 
:igr5423 {:name "rosuvastatin" :amount "1500ct" :expiration "09/01/2020"} 
:iuy6532 {:name "albuterol" :amount "1325ct" :expiration "01/01/2023"} 
:imnb78932 {:name "esomeprazole" :amount "23145ct" :expiration "10/01/2021"}})
</code>
	</pre></p>
	<p>Using the id of the medication as the key to all the other information about that medications means you can 
		manipulate or get the rest of the data even if all you know is its id. To get the name of the medication with the 
	id imnb78932 from the medications map, you'd write code like this.</p>

<pre><code class="Clojure">((medications :imnb78932) :name)
</code>
	</pre></p>
	<p>Remember, in Clojure, named values cannot be changed. It makes sence, then, that you can't change a value in a map. 
	Instead, a new named value is created when modification is required. This means that 'changing' a map or a vector is 
non-destructive. You get a changed version of the map or vector, but you still have access to the unmodified version as well. 
You 'update' a named value in a map like this.</p>
<pre><code class="Clojure">(def changed-medications (assoc-in medications [:imnb78932 :amount] "2200ct"))
</code>
	</pre></p>
	<p>The changed-medications named value now appears to be a copy of medications with the amount of the imnb78932 medication 
	modified to be 200ct. Appearances are deceptive. The writers of Clojure and other functional programming languages aren't 
naive. For this to be a full copy would be wasteful of both RAM and CPU resourses. How they do this is outside of the scope of 
this week's information. If you are interested in how they do it, the example of how vectors are 'modified' is covered early on 
in Chris Okasaki's seminal book on the topic, 
"<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Purely-Functional-Structures-Chris-Okasaki-ebook-dp-B00AKE1V04/dp/B00AKE1V04/ref=mt_kindle?_encoding=UTF8&me=&qid=1568926997">
Purely Functional Data Structures</a>."</p>
	<p>If you think about maps, since you can create maps of maps, you could create maps of maps of maps or maps of maps of maps of maps...
		or any level of 'mapishness.' These recursive map-in-map relationships, along with vectors-in-maps and maps-in-vecors, 
	is what you see in actual data sets used in applications.</p>
	<p> Want to know more about <a href="https://clojure.org/guides/learn/hashed_colls#_maps">maps</a>? Feel free to spend 
		some time with them learning about what they can do that is outside the scope of this class. 
	They can be a very powerful tool in your clojure toolbelt.</p>
