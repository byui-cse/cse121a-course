	<h1>Organization and Access</h1>
	<p>All computer languages are ways to organize your communication and thinking. In this, they are very
	similar to spoken languages. Each spoken language, or family of spoken languages, does this organization
	differently. English sentences often have a structure of Subject-Helper Verb-Verb-Predicate...The boy will bite the dog, for example.
	German, a language closely related to English, organizes things differently. Sometimes German sentences have a
        Subject-Helper Verb-Predicate-Verb structure. For example,
	Ich werde das Buch bald lesen, which if translated word-by-word is "I will the book soon read." Spanish is different yet again. 
	It's adjectives are placed after the nouns they modify.</p>
	<p>While each language has its own organizational rules, they all do the same thing. They allow us to organize and express
	our thinking.</p>
	<h3>Functions - the fundimental organization concept of Clojure</h3>
	<p>Clojure and Python have functions as a fundimental organizational structure. When you truly begin 
	thinking in Clojure, you will be thinking in functions. You will think of how functions are related to each other. You will 
	have thoughts along these lines, "If this function calls that one..." You will be able to do this since you will eventually
	realize that when you are designing solutions in Clojure, how a function accomplishes something is not as important as that it will, 
	and that you can wait to figure out how to complete the function later.</p>
	
	<p>Put an example here of desinging a solution thinking in functions.</p>
	<p>Since Python is a descendent of C and Clojure is not, there are differences between the languages regarding how you declare 
	functions.

	<p><pre>
<code class="Clojure">;defn means define function
(defn function-name [params] (
	;code goes here))</code>
	</pre></p>

	<p>Here is an example of defining a simple function printing a greeting and a farewell.</p>
<p><pre>
<code class="Clojure">
(defn hello-to [person-name](
             (println (str "Hello " person-name))
             (println (str "Goodbye " person-name))))</code>
	</pre></p>
	<p>Notice the thinking in functions. Functions are calling functions without worrying about how the 
	functions being called accomplish their task. Here, the function calls are three deep. Figure out what 
three deep means.</p>
<h3>Multi-arity Functions</h3>
<p>Sometimes you need a single function name to have different arities, different numbers of parameters. This is a simple example of 
how to accomplish this.</p>
<p><pre>
<code class="Clojure">
(defn hello-to
  ;if there no parameters are passed to the function
  ([] ;don't forget the space here.
   (println "Hello everybody") ;don't forget the space here.
   (println "Goodbye everybody"))
                                    
  ;if there one parameter is passed
  ([person-name] (println (str "Hello " person-name)) ;don't forget the space here.
   (println (str "Goodbye " person-name)))

  ;if there are two parameters passed
  ([person-name other-person-name] (println (str "Hello " person-name " and " other-person-name)) ;don't forget the space here.
   (println (str"Goodbye " person-name " and " other-person-name))))</code>
</pre></p>
	<p>Do not jump to an unwarented, mistaken conclusion. You don't have to have definitions for all arities. 
	You could have a function that defines behavior for and arity of 5 and an arity of 17 only. You would not have to define 
	behavior for arities 0 through 17. Also, as mentioned in the comments of the example, don't forget 
	the spaces indicated. You will learn why they are there next week.</p>
	<p>Clojure is a strongly typed language. This means that when you have multiple versions of a function 
	that differ by their arity, the types of each parameter must be the same. You could not, for example, have a 
	1-arity version that has a string and a 2-arity version that has two ints. The first parameter would have to 
	be a string.</p>
	<h3>Functions with Default Parameters</h3>
	<p>Clojure does not have syntax for defining default parameters as part of the function definition. Instead, 
		you create a multi-arity function where one version of the function calls the other, passing it an additional 
		value.
	</p>
	<p><pre><code class="Clojure">
(defn scale 
  ([size] (scale size 2)) 
  ([size amount] (* size amount)))</code>
</pre></p>
	<p>When this function is called with one parameter, the function calls itself, passing two parameters...the size and 2. 
	The 2-arity version of the function is then executed to mutlipley the size by the default value 2. If you pass both the 
	size and  amount to the scale function, the 2-arity version of the function is called directly. Recursive function calls 
	like this are a natural part of all functional programming langugages. Make sure you come to a very good understanding of 
	them. To aid you in your progress, here is an example of using recursion.</p>

	<p><pre>
	<code class="Clojure">(defn factorial
  ([n] (factorial n 1)) 
  ([n accumulator] 
   (if (= n 0) accumulator 
     (recur (dec n) (* accumulator n)))))</code></pre>
	</p>
	<h3>Bringing it All Together</h3>
	<p>Since you are an embryonic programmer and engineer, it is important that you develop 
		<a href="http://clojure-doc.org/articles/language/functions.html"> a more complete and more technical understanding of Clojure functions</a> 
		to prepare yourself for both your career and future classes. Explore beyond what you will learn 
		in this class. That is part of being a professional.
	</p>
	<p> Now that you've had an initial exposure to functions, you should go back to <a href="../week02/index.html">last week's material</a>  
	and take a look at the functions that are used in Clojure instead of operators. Take a cut at how you might have defined each of those functions 
	if you had written Clojure. This will help you with your 'thinking in functions' ability.</p> 
	<p>
		You will be using functions for all the rest of the weeks you are in this class. Next week, you will 
		be using functions and learning more about them.
	</p>
