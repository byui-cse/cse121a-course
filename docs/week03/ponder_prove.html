      The Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of integers is well known in math. This
      method for finding, usually for a pair of numbers, which of their divisors
      that they have in common is the greatest <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm">dates back to Euclid</a>, and is usually
      studied early on in a course on algorithms.
  </p>

  <p>
      More precisely, the GCD of two nonnegative, not-both-zero integers <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>,
      denoted <i>gcd(a, b)</i>, is defined as the largest integer that divides both <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>
      evenly, i.e., with a remainder of zero. As you will learn when you take a
      course on discrete mathematics, the central fact of numbers exploited by the
      algorithm that computes the GCD is that
  </p>

  <p>
      <i>gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, a % b)</i>,
  </p>

  <p>
      where &lsquo;%&rsquo; is the mod operator that returns the remainder when <i>a</i> is divided by <i>b</i>.
  </p>

  <p>
      Here is high-level pseudocode for the GCD algorithm:
  </p>

  <p class="verse">
      1. Apply repeatedly the equality<br />
      <br />
      &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;<i>gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, a % b)</i><br />
      <br />
      2. until <i>a</i> % <i>b</i> is equal to 0.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
      Since <i>gcd(n, 0) = n</i>, for any <i>n</i>, the last <i>b</i> (which is also the last non-zero
      remainder) is the answer &#x2014; the GCD of the original <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>.
  </p>

  <p>
      One of the main uses of the GCD function is to convert fractions to lowest
      terms. This is done by finding the GCD of the numerator and denominator of the
      fraction, and dividing both by their GCD. It is helpful to trace through this
      function to get an idea of how it works.
  </p>
	<h1>Your Tasks</h1>
  <p>
      Your warm-up task is to create in Clojure a GCD tracer by
      &lsquo;instrumenting&rsquo; (i.e, adding
      print statements to show the steps) a <i>recursive</i> GCD function.
  </p>

  <p>
      Your main task is to use GCDs to prove that a given number is NOT prime, but
      instead is a prime pretender &#x2014; which means it &lsquo;fools&rsquo; the <i>Fermat Primality
      Test</i> for every base <b>relatively prime</b> to it. (Look these terms up.)
  </p>

  <p>
      Using Clojure functions that you will write, answer for each of the following
      two numbers, is it prime or is it a prime pretender?
