	<h1>The Why of Clojure</h1>
	<h3>Some Background</h3>
	<p>Clojure is a dialect of Lisp, a language designed in 1958 and still in use.
	Because Lisp was created so long ago, there are concepts in computing that are
	now common, but didn&rsquo;t exist way back then. For example, parallel
	computing was not a thing so Lisp doesn&rsquo;t have parallel computing
	&lsquo;baked in&rsquo; from the beginning. It has been added, but since it is
	added on, it can be somewhat clunky. Clojure, on the other hand, was designed
	to leverage what is good about Lisp and the parallelism available in the Java
	Virtual Machine. Clojure was also designed to be a functional programming
	language, making parallel programming safer and easier.</p>
	<p>
		Clojure being one of many functional programming language means that, in
		Clojure, collections of data and individual pieces of data are immutable. In
		other words, there are no variables in Clojure. While this may come as a
		shock to you because of your Python background, it is a completely valid way
		of writing very good code. It also means that you can write parallel code
		without creating the two huge, common problems in parallel code written for
		languages that have variables, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34510/what-is-a-race-condition">race conditions</a>
		and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34512/what-is-a-deadlock">cross or dead-locks</a>. Thankfully, Clojure and other functional
		programming languages don&rsquo;t have variables, and so it&rsquo;s impossible to create either of these problems.
	</p>
	<p>
		Another advantage of being a functional programming language is that
		functions are and can be treated just like data. You can pass a function as
		a parameter, you can return a function from a call to a different function,
		and many other very cool things. This means that functions like map, filter,
		and reduce, you saw these in Python, are no different than any other
		function you can create, and you don&rsquo;t need that weird lambda keyword
		that Python has. Also, since functions are data, you can put functions in
		lists and maps. When done well, this makes your code extremely flexible and
		powerful.</p>
	<h3>Python and Clojure are Related</h3>
	<p>Take a look at Figure 1. It shows the ancestry of both Clojure and Python.
	Since Clojure and Python share some ancestry, you can expect to see echos of
	things in Python in Clojure. An example of this is the concept of a range.
	However, Python is not Clojure&rsquo;s only ancestor, nor its most significant
	one. The strongest contributor is Lisp, followed closely by Haskell, so you
	can expect to see Lisp-ish syntax that is significantly different than what
	you learned for Python.</p>

<h1>Installation</h1>
	<h2>The Virtual Machine</h2>
	<p>
      If it isn&rsquo;t already installed on your machine, start by installing
      <a href="https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk12-downloads-5295953.html">
      the JDK</a> (Java Developer Kit) for your computer. The link leads you to
      download an installer. Run the installer using the default values the
      installer suggests. The JDK includes the Virtual Machine, not a real piece
      of hardware, that your Clojure code will run on. By leveraging this VM,
      your Clojure code won&rsquo;t need to be compiled to run on your specific
      hardware.
  <h2>The Integrated Development Environment</h2>
	<p>No Integrated Development Environment (IDE) will be used in this class!</p>
	<p>
      There are many editors and IDEs that can be used to write Clojure. IDEs do
      make it much easier to do the write-run-debug cycle that is programming,
      but almost all of them require climbing a steep learning curve that would
      distract you from the core purpose of this course.
  </p>
  <p>
      So use an editor you are comfortable with to write your code, but the IDE
      substitute we will use in this class (at least at first) is found at <a
      href="https://repl.it/">https://repl.it</a>. This site states its purpose
      front and center: Code and collaborate, without friction [with] our free,
      collaborative, in-browser IDE [without] spending a second on setup.
  </p>
	<p>
      Go there and select Clojure from the start coding pulldown menu. The
      Clojure REPL (Read-Eval-Print-Loop) that will start up is running on a
      virtual server in the cloud, so there is nothing you need to install on
      your local machine. It is much like the Python REPL, so as you might
      expect, you can type in valid Clojure and execute it just like you could
      in the Python REPL.
	</p>
	<p>
      As a preview of things to come, let&rsquo;s use the REPL to add together
      four numbers, 1, 2, 3, and 4. Type into the REPL what you see below:
      <p><pre>
          <code class="Clojure">
            (+ 1 2 3 4)
          </code>
      </pre></p>
  </p>
	<p>
		Here you see the impact of having Lisp as Clojure&rsquo;s strongest ancestor
		instead of C. Python&rsquo;s + operator is borrowed from and acts much like
		the + operator in C. Clojure doesn&rsquo;t have a + operator. Instead it has
		a + function. We&rsquo;ll get into this in detail later, but what
		you&rsquo;ve done in this code is pass multiple parameters, the numbers 1,
		2, 3, and 4, to Clojure&rsquo;s + function. This is, after all, a functional
		programming language so you can expect it to use functions whenever
		possible. &#128525</p>
	<p>
      Also notice that Clojure doesn&rsquo;t have commas separating the
      parameters, whereas Python does. Python borrowed that syntax from C.</p>
<h1>Hello World</h1>
    In a REPL, this traditional first program is trivial to write:
<p><pre>
    <code class="Clojure">
    "Hello, World!"
</code>
</pre></p>
   Trivial because typing that into the REPL will evaluate and print that string!
   Strings evaluate to themselves and are printed surrounded by double quotes, just
   like you enter them.
<h2>Where is main?</h2>
<p>
    Only slightly less trivial is to wrap that raw string into a call to the
    println (print line) function. When you enter the following into the REPL
    note the difference in output from when you just entered the string.
</p>
<p><pre>
    <code class="Clojure">
    (println "Hello, World!")
    </code>
</pre></p>
<p>
    However, the typical non-REPL way to greet the world is to wrap this println
    call in a main function and then run it. How to define a main function (like
    the one you saw in Python) and run it outside the REPL will come later.
<h1>Done!</h1>
<p>Congrats!!! You&rsquo;re all set up and ready to go. If you want to see all
the built-in functions that are part of Clojure, take a look at the <a href="https://clojure.github.io/clojure/clojure.core-api.html">
