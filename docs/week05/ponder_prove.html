<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<p>Run-Length Encoding (RLE) is an interesting type of compression for data
	 files. Some files, like bitmap images, have large areas where the numbers
	 representing the image don&rsquo;t change (imagine an image with large numbers of
	 big black areas in it). The idea behind RLE is this: if there are 100 fives
	 in a row, why keep all the fives? Instead, let us replace 99 of those fives
	 with a 100. Then the pair 100 5 can represent the 100 fives in a lot less
	 disk space. There are many different RLE algorithms, and you should feel free
	 to explore those used to compress files, but your task is more interesting
	 than that. That&rsquo;s because you are going to compress a subset of an
	 infinite set!</p>

	<p>The set of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number">Natural numbers</a>
    is infinite. Here is a mathmatical representation of an RLE-encoded finite
    <a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/sequences-series.html">sequence</a>
    of numbers beginning at 2 using a unique and interesting version of Run-Length Encoding:</p>

   <p>RLEPRIMES=(1,1,0,1,0,1,3,1,0,1,3,1,0,1,3,1,5,1,0,1,5,1,3,1,0,1,3,1,5,1,5,1,0,1,5,1,3,1,0,1,5,1,3,1,5,1,7,1,3)</p>

	 <p>The RLE algorithm used to produce this set of numbers is different than
	 that used for images. In it, a 1 represents a prime number, a 0 represents an
	 isolated composite number, and any other number found in the sequence
	 represents how many composite numbers there are in a row before the next
	 prime number.</p>

	 <h1>Your Task</h1>
	 <p>
       Use recursion and if/when or if-let/when-let BIFs to write a function
       called decode_prime_list that will decode any list passed to it as
	     a parameter that is encoded using this interesting version of RLE. Your
	     function must produce the list of prime numbers contained in RLEPRIMES or
	     any similarly encoded list. The result list must be ordered from least to
	     greatest.

       <h3>Review</h3>
       <h4>After completing the previous steps:</h4>
       <ol>
           <li>Review one of the many <a href="https://byui-cse.github.io/cse121a-course/week05/provided_solutions/tasks.clj">possible solutions</a> for this task,</li>
           <li>Compare and contrast your code with the possible solutions&rsquo; code, and</li>
           <li>Make note of any improvements you could make for future tasks.</li>
