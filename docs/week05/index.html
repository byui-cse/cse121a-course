	<h3>Logic Used in Clojure</h3>
	<p>Clojure, and most other computing languages use Boolean Logic. In other words, something is true or it is false. 
	There are other types of logic. For example, there are ternary (three value) logics where possible values are true, false, and maybe. 
	You use this ternary type of logic in your life all the time. Someone asks, "Do can you help me next week?" Replying 
	in English, you have three options. Yes (true)...if you know you can and will. No (false)...if you know you can't or won't. 
	Maybe...if you are unsure if you can or will. See? Three possible values thus ternary logic rather than Boolean Logic. </p>
	<p>Clojure uses Binary Logic. Something is either true or false. The 'maybe' value (nil), in Clojure, is treated as false.</p>
	<h3>When-Let and If-Let</h3>
	<h4>If-Let</h4>
	<p>Clojure has a construct you may not have seen before...it's called if-let. It allows you to conditionally define a named 
	value, and, if the named value is able to be defined, execute a code clause. It also includes a required else clause. In this 
	example, a collection is filtered so that only the evens remain. Should there be no evens in the collection, the else clause 
	is executed.</p>
	<p><pre><code class="Clojure">(if-let [evens (seq (filterv even? coll))]
    (println (str "Evens are: " evens))
    (println "No evens"))
</code>
	</pre></p>
	<h4>When-Let</h4>
	<p>Sometimes, you don't need an alternative to the condition you are checking for. When this is the situation you find yourself in, 
	you should use when-let rather than if-let. This example illustrates just such a situation. The function drop-first returns 
	a collection that has the all the same elements as the one passed in, but without the first element. If the list is empty, 
	drop-first returns nil.</p>
	<p><pre><code class="Clojure">(defn drop-first [coll]
  (when-let [s (seq coll)]
    (rest s)))
</code>
	</pre></p>
	<h3>Cond</h3>
	<p>For those situations where you have more than one condition, each with a different result, you should use cond. This is a 
	silly, naive example since the compare function already exists in Clojure.</p>
<p><pre><code class="Clojure">(defn compare-nums [a b] 
  (cond
    (< a b) -1
    (> a b)  1
    :else    0))
</code>
	</pre></p>


	<h3>When and If</h3>
	<p>The if-let, when-let, and cond BIF's will fit nearly every need. So if using them solves your coding design problem, you should 
	use them. In those rare situations where those three BIF's don't fit, Clojure provides you with when and if.</p>
	<p>Here is an example using the when BIF to print an age if it is not nil.</p>
<p><pre><code class="Clojure">(when (some? age)
(println (str "You are " age ".")))
</code>
	</pre></p>
<p>Here is an example of using the if BIF in the same situation.</p>
	<p><pre><code class="Clojure">(if (some? age)
(println (str "You are " age "."))
(println (str "Oops. There is no age.")))
</code>
	</pre></p>
