	<h1>Your Two Tasks</h1>

  <h2>Rational number representation</h2>

  <p>
      One of the problems you run into is that computers are really bad at
      representing numbers with decimal points, and you really can&rsquo;t trust them.
  </p>

  <p>
      This task is intended to help you start making this transition in your thinking.
  </p>
  <h3>The Task</h3>
  <p>
      All rational numbers where the numerators and denominators do not have any
      common factors (reduced to lowest terms) have a repeating sequence of digits
      (called the period) after the decimal point.
  </p>

  <p>
      Using numbers of your choice of size less than 1000, find five rational numbers
      whose float versions do not match Wolfram-Alpha&rsquo;s representation of that number.
      Also, find five that do match.
  </p>
  <h2>Permutations and combinations of strings</h2>
  <p>
      Computer scientists often have to deal with large data sets that are generated
      by combinations of simpler things.
  </p>

  <p>
      In machine learning we often encounter the strange fascination of grappling
      with large data sets that we would like to classify into smaller, more
      comprehensible sets. Generating decision trees is one method that has been
      employed to good advantage. However, decision trees can be large and very
      complex, thus hard to deal with. Research is ongoing into discovering
      efficient methods for &ldquo;pruning&rdquo; and thus shrinking these data structures to a
      more manageable size.
  </p>

  <p>
      Consider IBM&rsquo;s Deep Blue chess program, whose capability of
      evaluating 200 million positions per second was accomplished mainly
      through brute force computer power. Beating world champion Gary Kasparov
      in 1997 was its main claim to fame, though it had nothing powering it that
      remotely resembled machine learning artificial intelligence. That is 21<sup>st</sup>
      century technology!
  </p>

  <p>
      You are likely going to encounter similar seemingly impossible tasks in your
      computer science career, so why not start getting some practice now?
  </p>
  <h3>The Task</h3>

  <p>
      If you were to write some code that would generate all the possible anagrams of
      &ldquo;asdf&rdquo;, how many answers would you have to look at to find all the English words?
  </p>

  <p>
      In Clojure you can divide up a string into individual characters using this code:
  </p>

  <code class="Clojure">
    (def chars (seq (char-array "asdf")))
  </code>

  <p>
      You can join them back together using join:
  </p>

  <code class="Clojure">
      (clojure.string/join chars)
  </code>

  <p>
      In between you could rearrange the characters to join them back as a different word.
      Feel free to explore how you would do that, but your assignment here is to calculate
      how many &ldquo;permutations&rdquo; (google it) there are.
  </p>

  <p>
      Use the formula \(_{n}{}P_{k} \equiv \frac{n!}{(n-k)!}\)
  </p>

  <p>
      where n is the number of characters in the whole string, and k is the number
      of characters in the generated words. Your task is to write one line of code
      that calculates how many three-character strings you have to look through to
      find all recognizable words if the original string is the following short
      phrase:
  </p>

      <h3>Review</h3>
      <h4>After completing the previous steps:</h4>
      <ol>
          <li>Review one of the many <a href="https://byui-cse.github.io/cse121a-course/week02/instructor_solution.html">possible solutions</a> for this task,</li>
          <li>Compare and contrast your code with the possible solutions&rsquo; code, and</li>
          <li>Make note of any improvements you could make for future tasks.</li>
