	<h1>Assessing Online Sources</h1>
	<p>Throughout this course, you've been exposed to multiple sources of information about the language. 
	This week, you are asked to spend about three hours pondering and reasoning about the sources of 
	information you've experienced.</p>
	<p>Your pondering and reasoning should include thinking about these types of things. What, do you think, made the difference between a good source and one that wasn't so good? Have you 
	learned to tell reputable sources from iffy ones? How have you begun to differentiate between reputable 
	and iffy sources? If, for example, you were going to answer someone's coding question about this language, 
	what should you do to be a reputable source? What online sources have you used and in what order would you 
	rank them for quality and usability?</p>
